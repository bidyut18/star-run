## ✨ Features

- ⚡️ **Near‑instant startup** – written in Go, boots in ~3–5 ms with zero runtime overhead.
- 🧠 **Smart detection** – automatically traverses parent directories to identify the correct environment.
- 📡 **Signal forwarding** – gracefully handles `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` to safely shut down running scripts.
- 📦 **Trivial distribution** – installs as a standalone static binary natively via npm.
